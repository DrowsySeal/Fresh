            <h5 id="shipping">Shipping</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Drowsy Seal uses the United States Postal Service (USPS) or UPS for all shipments, unless otherwise discussed. <strong>Shipping costs must be covered by you upon completion of the project.</strong></li>
                <li>The project will be shipped within 3-5 business days of completion and approval. A tracking number will be provided for United States residents.</li>

                <li>For shipping outside of the US, you will be responsible for any customs fees or duties your product incurs. Please take note of what the incurring taxes and fees will be before committing to a commission. <strong>Note:</strong> I do not ship to the EU at this time, due to the complexity of import laws.</li>

                <li>Between December 10th and January 5th, Drowsy Seal will not ship out any large orders. This is due to the increased risk of lost, stolen, and damaged items caused by holiday rush.</li>

            </ul>

                <li>If the costume arrives with a damaged box, please take photos of the box before opening it. If the costume inside is damaged, please take photos of the damage and contact Drowsy Seal immediately.</li>
                <li>Drowsy Seal offers a 30 day warranty. This allows for repairs and fixes on any mistakes made by Drowsy Seal. Shipping to us is your responsibility, but we will pay for shipping back to you.</li>

            </ul>
            <h5>Revisions</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>In the beginning stages of the commission process, a digital reference sheet of the suit design will be created and sent for approval. Any requested changes to the design <strong>MUST</strong> be made at this stage.</li> 
              <li>Any changes thereafter will incur additional fees.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Refunds/Cancellations</h5>

              <li>Payment processing fees will not be refunded.</li>
              <li>A $100 deposit is non-refundable to cover the time communicating with the client and other preparatory labor.</li>
              <li>If a commission is cancelled by Drowsy Seal due to unexpected events, the client may choose between being refunded in full, or be issued a partial refund with any completed costume parts.</li>
              <li>If the commission must be cancelled by Drowsy Seal due to client neglect and/or harassment, a 30% retainment fee will not be refunded under any circumstances.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Communication</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>All correspondence will be done via email.</li>
              <li>If no response is received within 30 days, the commission will be considered abandoned and will be canceled without refund.</li>
              <li>If you will be away and unable to respond, please inform me ahead of time. Communication is important!</li>
              <li>Multiple work in progress photos will be provided. If changes are requested, they must be communicated within 24 hours of receiving the photos.</li>
              <li>If no response is received within 24 hours, progress on the commission will continue. If changes are requested after that window, fees may apply.</li>
            </ul>
            <!--
            <h5 id="quotes">Quotes</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>You must be 18 years of age or older to apply for a quote. You must have a valid quote in order to apply for a commission.</li>
              <li>Quotes will be available approximately one week before a commission opening, on Ko-Fi. They will be valid for the next two commission openings only. Afterwards, you must get a new quote.</li>
              <li>We will not simplify your design for you. Please ensure that your reference sheet reflects how you expect the finished fursuit to look. Additional fees will occur if there are changes to the design after the commission is accepted.</li>
              <li>Reference sheets must be <strong>safe for work</strong>. "Not safe for work" reference sheets will be ignored.</li>
              <li>Receiving a quote does not mean you have been accepted for a commission.</li>
