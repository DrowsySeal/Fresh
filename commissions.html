            <h5>Applications</h5>
            <p>When commissions are open, you may submit your application via the designated form. I work with budget-based offers, starting at or above my base <strong><a href="/pricing.html">pricing</a></strong>. The form will ask you to submit a fursuit-friendly reference sheet, the type of fursuit you are looking to get, and your offer.</p>
              
            <p><strong>You must be 18 years of age or older to apply for a commission.</strong></p>
            <span id="quote-status"></span>
                <ul>
                  <strong>Reference sheet requirements:</strong>
                    <li>Fursuit friendly, with simplified spots and stripes, and <strong>no gradients</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Safe for work</strong>. NSFW reference sheets will be ignored</li>
                    <li>Clean and unshaded, human-created artwork</li>
                    <li>Two or more full anthro body views, showing the front and back at minimum</li>
                    <li>Tongue, paw pads, claws, and other details must be included</li>
                    <li>The character must be yours. I will not replicate copyrighted characters</li>
                    <li>Character changes are not accepted after commission acceptance, so please make sure your reference sheet is accurate!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <!--<div class="grid-container full" id="fast-links">
              <a class="button" href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-disabled="true">Commission Application</a>
            </div>-->
            <h5>Acceptance</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Once your commission is accepted, a 50% down payment is required within 48 hours. The remaining 50% must be paid off within 30 days.</li>
                <li>Once your down payment has been paid, you will be officially added to our queue! c:</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Turnaround</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Our <a href="https://trello.com/b/gonT1G1E/drowsyseal-queue"><strong>queue</strong></a> is kept very short, and will be worked in order of full payment received.</li>
                <li>We aim to keep our queue under a 6 month turnaround time from full payment date to completion.</li>
                <li>We will do my best to work with a specific timeline, but please understand that con deadlines are not accepted.</li>
                <li>In order to keep turnaround times extremely short, I keep the official queue down to 2-3 slots. Everyone else goes into the waitlist, and gets slowly added into the regular queue. For the first few projects, I will ask for payment up front. However, payment for those on the waitlist will not be requested until it is time to start the next batch of projects.</li>
                <li>If you do not have funds by the time I am ready to start on your project, you will be removed from the queue and will have to reapply in the future.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Progress</h5>
            <p>We pride ourselves in excellent communication, and will include WIP photos at every major step of the commission progress. Please be prompt in approval or with any desired changes, as a delay in responding may result in an inaccurate completion time.</p>
            <ul><strong>Steps include:</strong>
                <li>Digital reference creation</li>
                <li>Picking out furs and fabrics</li>
                <li>Headbase creation</li>
                <li>Bodysuit 3d modeling (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Taping and patterning</li>
                <li>Eye design</li>
                <li>Details</li>
                <li>Final photos</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note: For fullsuit commissions, we do not work off DTDs! We require around 20 measurements and three photos of you from the front, side, and back. These must be taken in form-fitting clothing to ensure proper fit. We will send documents immediately before beginning your project, so please fill these out and return them in a timely manner.</p>
            <h5>Shipping</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Shipping costs must be covered by you at the completion of the project.</li>
                <li>Shipping within the US can range from $60 to $200 or more, depending on the size of the project.</li>
                <li>Please view our <a href="/tos.html#shipping"><strong>Shipping Terms</strong></a> for more information.</li>
            </ul>
